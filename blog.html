    One big challenge I had with this assignment was trying to remember all the html syntax and language
    that I had learned before but forgotten. Along with the html index, I also struggled some with github
    and github commands and getting my local folder in sync with the repository. For most of these problems,
    I used Google (my best friend) and searched up the answer to my questions. From this assignment, I learned
    that this will be a very interesting and fun class, and that github is a lot more complicated and precise
    than I remembered. I already knew that html would be harder than just "essay coding", and I'm excited
    to integrate CSS/JS into the html coding that I already know. To be honest, my biggest resource for this
    assignment has got to be Google and the website w3schools.com. It was definitely very helpful in giving
    me the tips and hints that I needed to be reminded of in order to complete the given assignment.
