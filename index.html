<h1>Name: Johnny Po </h1>

<h2>Major/Year: Computer Science and Sophomore </h2>

<p>On a scale of 1-10, I'd say I'm at around a 3.5. </p>

<p>I hope to learn much more about HTML and especially CSS/JS in order to better present myself to the world </p>

<p>I have indeed signed up for Piazza</p>

<br></br>

<p>One very interesting thing about me is that I'm very into photography (as well as videography).
  I started taking pictures since I was just a freshman in high school, and since then I've developed
  my own "business" taking senior portrait pictures for both clients and family. I loved what I could do
  with a camera, and I actually used HTML in order to present both myself and my work to the world
  through the internet. </p>
